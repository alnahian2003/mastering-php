 Let's think of a situation where we're building a game. There will be 3 types of players. First, simple regular players with some basic functionalities. Second, Desktop Players. We'll extend some more functionalities in this case. Finally, Console Players where will be the functions as the Desktop Players with some different functionalities. Let's do it!

 So, the interface structure will be like this:
 Basic = Regular Players
 Advanced = Regular Players -> Desktop Players 
 Pro = Regular Players -> Desktop Players -> Console Players

//  Interface for Regular Players
interface player
{
    // Basic Player Movements
    public function moveUp();
    public function moveDown();
    public function moveLeft();
    public function moveRight();
    public function move($callback); // it will take any other movement function as param

    // Basic Actions
    public function fire();
    public function reload();
    public function throw($throwableItemName); // Grenade, Flashbang, Rock, Weapon
}


//  Interface for Desktop Players
interface desktopPlayer extends player
{
    // Special Movements and Actions for Desktop Players Only
    public function prone();
    public function crouch();
    public function scope();
    public function weapons();

//  Interface for Console Players
interface consolePlayer extends desktopPlayer

    public function bulletTime();
    public function melee();
    public function jump();
